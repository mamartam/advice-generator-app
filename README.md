# Advice generator app
This project was created based on a Frontend Mentor [https://www.frontendmentor.io/] challenge. The layout and design idea come from Frontend Mentor, while the code implementation is my own.

## 📦 Technologies
- HTML5 – Semantic structure for better accessibility and SEO.
- CSS3 – Custom properties (variables), Flexbox, and mobile-first responsive design.
- JavaScript (ES6+) – Asynchronous programming with async/await and DOM manipulation.
- Advice Slip API – External REST API integration to fetch real-time data.
- Google Fonts – Typography using the "Manrope" variable font.

## 📚 What I Learned
This project was a great opportunity to practice several core web development concepts:
- Asynchronous JavaScript: I gained hands-on experience using async/await to handle API requests. I also implemented a try...catch...finally block to manage errors and ensure a smooth user experience.
- API Interaction: I learned how to fetch data from a REST API and dynamically update the DOM with the received JSON data.
- Accessibility: I focused on making the app accessible by using semantic HTML tags (<main>, <article>), adding aria-label to the interactive button, and hiding decorative images from screen readers using aria-hidden.
- CSS State Management: I practiced using the :disabled and :active pseudo-classes to provide visual feedback to the user while waiting for a new advice to load.
- Responsive Design: Using the <picture> tag allowed me to efficiently serve different assets (mobile vs. desktop dividers) based on the user's screen size.

## 🚀 How It Can Be Improved?
While the current version is fully functional, here are some features and optimizations I would like to implement in the future:
- Social Sharing: Adding a "Share to Twitter" or "Copy to Clipboard" feature so users can easily save and share the advice they like.
- Advice History: Implementing local storage to keep track of the last few pieces of advice generated during a session.
- Custom Animations: Adding CSS-keyframe animation for the text transition to make it fade in or slide smoothly when new advice appears.
- Dark/Light Mode: Implementing a theme switcher to allow users to toggle between different color schemes.
